# Civsim
## Introduction
Civsim is a basic civilisation simulation and modelling system built in Python 3.8. It requires the following packages:

```
perlin_noise==1.7
termcolor==1.1.0
```

## Features
Currently civsim supports the following features:
* Terrain generation using Perlin noise (including biomes)
* Civilisation generation with different priorities and favoured terrain etc
* Civilisation growth, expansion, stabilisation, destabilisation, collapse, and death
* Successor states and breakaway states

## Todo
* Diplomacy between nations
* Possibly some sort of ruler system to see national priorities change over time
* Playing as a civ?
* Expanding over water
