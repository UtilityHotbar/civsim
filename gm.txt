You're standing in a dark, dank dungeon room...
The dungeon stretches out in front of you...
It's very, very dark. It almost feels like the shadows are clawing at you...
You don't feel safe at all...
In the distance you can hear the scuttling of strange creatures...

You can't go that way.
That's the edge of the world, sorry.
Look, we're out of map, ok?
